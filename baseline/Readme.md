# Baseline implementation

## Implementation details
We implement the most of the baselines in our pipeline based on the [offical code](https://github.com/qitianwu/GraphOOD-GNNSafe) of [1] and base on it, we integrate the code of DOCTOR and CRL.

## How to run the code
We release the scripts to run all the baseline in `run_base.sh`
